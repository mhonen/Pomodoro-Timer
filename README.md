# Pomodoro-Timer
Timer to separate work from breaks: Learning project from Dr. Angela Yu's 100 days of code: Python

This was my first attempt on creating a timer using Python's TKINTER package.  The program shows a window in which the user
can start a timer.  The timer separates time into three major states: Work, Short Break, and Long Break.
